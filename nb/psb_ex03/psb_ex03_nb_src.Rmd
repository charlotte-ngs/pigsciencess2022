## Problem 1 Analysis of Variance
Estimate the variance component for the sire effect using an analysis of variance. The data is available from `https://charlotte-ngs.github.io/pigsciencess2022/data/gel_sire_w10.csv`. Because the data contains just female animals, the fixed effect of the sex can no longer be estimated. 


### Hint
* Use the functions `aov()` to do the analysis of variance and the function `summary()` on the ANOVA result to get the relevant parts of the variance components.


### Your Solution
Start by reading the data. 

```{r}
# read data using readr::read_csv2()

```

Compute the anova

```{r}
# use aov() to get anova result

```

Compute variance components using the Mean Sq.

```{r}
# Mean Sq from aov results to get variance components

```






## Problem 2: Variance Components Estimation Using REML
Use the same data set as for Problem 1 and a sire model to estimate the same sire variance $\sigma_s^2$. The sire model is the linear mixed effects model that contains sire effects as random component. The model can be specified as 

$$y = Xb + Zs + e$$

where $y$ is the vector of observations, $b$ is the vector of fixed effects which are the same as in Problem 1, $s$ is the vector of random sire effects and $e$ is the vector of random error terms. 

### Hint 
* Use the package `pedigreemm` to get a REML estimate for the sire variance component $\sigma_s^2$. 
* We assume that the sires are not related. Hence variance-covariance matrix $var(s)$ of the sire components are $var(s) = I * \sigma_s^2$. 



### Your Solution
The package `pedigreemm` is used to get to the variance components.

```{r}
# The function pedigreemm::pedigree() is used to specify the pedigree.

```

Variance components are part of the results from function `pedigreemm()` of package `pedigreemm`. 

```{r}
# Variance components from `pedigreemm::pedigreemm()`

```





## Problem 3: Variance Components Estimation Using an Animal Model
We are given the dataset with the response variable `carcass weight` (CW) and the predictor variables that resulted from the model selection process from Exercise 1. These consisted of

* sex (`sex`)
* slaughterhouse (`slh`)
* herd (`hrd`)
* age at slaughter (`age`)

The data is available from `https://charlotte-ngs.github.io/pigsciencess2022/data/gel_bp_w10.csv`. 

We use a mixed linear effects model to estimate the variance components for the random effects in the model.

\begin{equation}
y = Xb + Za + e
\end{equation}

where $y$ is a vector of observations, $b$ is a vector of fixed effects found to be relevant in Exercise 1, $a$ is a vector of random breeding values and $e$ is a vector of random errors. 


### Hint
* Use the package `pedigreemm` to get an estimate of the variance components


### Your Task
* Estimate the variance components $\sigma_a^2$ and $\sigma_e^2$ for the two random component $a$ and $e$, respectively.


### Your Solution
Start by reading the data. 

```{r}
# Read data using `readr::read_csv2()`

```

Use `pedigreemm::pedigree()` to specify the pedigree. 

```{r}
# pedigree ...

```

Variance components are obtained from function `pedigreemm()`

```{r}
# Variance components ...
```
