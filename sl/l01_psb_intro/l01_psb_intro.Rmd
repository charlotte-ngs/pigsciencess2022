## Terminology

```{r psb-terminology, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", out.width="100%"}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/psb-terminology.odg")

## Scientific Definition 

> "Selection and Mating of parents are used such that offspring generations are closer to a defined goal."

* Distinction between 
    + livestock breeding and production
    + cattle breeding and milk or beef production
    + pig breeding and pork production and 
    + chicken breeding and egg producers

```{r breedingassociation, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", fig.pos='H', out.width='11cm'}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic("odg/breedingassociation.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/breedingassociation.png")
```

```{r bprogdiag, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", fig.pos='H', out.width='11cm'}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/bprogdiag.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/bprogdiag.png")
```


## Parts of Breeding Program

* Applied prediction of breeding values is a part of the breeding program
* Design and planning of a breeding program requires to answer the questions
    + What goal do we want to achieve
    + What measures do we want to use to achieve the goal
    
    
## Types of Breeding Programs

Two types of breeding programs

1. Focus on __selection response__
    + countries with limited resources
    + big farms or big companies
2. Focus on clients and services
    + cattle and pig breeding of developed countries
    + economic interest of companies and farms


## Breeding Goals
Types of breeding goals

* economic
* biological
* tactical
* ethical

Breeding goals might be formulated in different ways

* __political__: description of idealized image of future animal. Often conflicting and not verifiable
* __scientific__: mathematical description of direction of desired change. Measurable via selection response



## Performance Testing

* Basic question: What trait is measured when for which animals
* Breeding should be based on data
* Quality of derived parameters (heritability, predicted breeding values) depend on accuracy of collected data
* Data collection used for performance testing often started for different reasons
    + milk sample testing: quality of product
    + station testing in pigs: correction of environment
    
    
## Classification of Performance Tests
* Place
    + Station
    + Field
* Relationship between selection candidate and tested animal
    + own performance record
    + full-sib
    + progeny
* Traits
    + should have genetic variation
    + economic importance
    + measurable better than subjectively observed
    
    
## Examples: Pigs

```{r pigperftest, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", out.width='11cm'}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic("odg/pigperftest.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/pigperftest.png")
```


## Examples: Cattle

```{r cattleperftest, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", out.width='11cm'}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/cattleperftest.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/cattleperftest.png")
```



## Prediction Of Breeding Values
* Done in most breeding programs
* Federal regulation
* Performance tests much more expensive
* Different intervals
    + cattle: three times per year
    + pigs: nightly or weekly
    
    
## Progress In Technologies
* Reproduction - AI
    + disease prevention
    + number of progeny per sire increased
    + better comparisons between herds
    + Future: more development on female side
* Molecular Biology
    + cheap and efficient large-scale genotyping
    + sequencing with more accuracy
* Computer Science
    + efficient evaluation of large amounts of data
    + big data technologies - continuous monitoring
    
    
## Differences Of BP Between Species

Breeding programs (BP) for different species have different structure

* __hierarchical__: pigs and chicken
* __flat__: cattle and horse


## Hierarchical Structure

```{r HierarchischeZuchtstruktur,echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", out.width='11cm'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/HierarchischeZuchtstruktur.png")
```


## Monolithic Structure

```{r MonolithicBp, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", out.width='11cm'}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic("odg/MonolithicBp.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/MonolithicBp.png")
```


## Example of Implementation

* Assume: pig breeding organisation
* Improvement of animal at production level with respect to economic profitability
* Implementation of scientific breeding program
* Start to design and to develop economic breeding goal
* Combine economically important traits into an aggregate genotype ($H$)
* Use hierarchical structure


## Hierarchical Breeding Program

```{r gel-implbp-hier-bp, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", out.width="11cm"}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/gel-implbp-hier-bp.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/gel-implbp-hier-bp.png")
```


## Three Steps To Design Economic Breeding Goal

The following steps are needed to implement a breeding program

1. description of production system
2. modelling profit of a typical herd
3. derive economic values


## Production System

```{r implbp-prodsys, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", out.width="11cm"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/implbp-prodsys.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/implbp-prodsys.png")
```
 

## What is a Production System

* Simulation of production herd
* Collect input parameters (costs, biological parameters, labor, ...) from literature
* Use collected input parameters for simulation
* Run simulation
* Record output quantities (revenue, animals sold)


## Why Production System

* Profit is computed based on revenue and costs
* Characteristics and traits of animals with impact on profitability are found
* Impact of traits on profitability detected by changing input parameters
* Progeny must meet needs of production farms
* Breeders must select parents such that optimal progeny produced for production farms


## Structure of Production System

* Assume a hierarchical structure of the breeding program
* Alternatively: mixed farms in monolithic structure
* Breeding (and possibly multiplier) farms are selling their progeny to production farms


## Example Of Typical Production Farm

```{r example-prodfarm, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", out.width="11cm"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/example-prodfarm.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/example-prodfarm.png")
```


## Traits Of Interest

* Profit ($P$) of production farm determined by revenues ($R$) and costs ($C$)

$$P = R - C$$

* Traits of economic interest influence $P$
* Restrict ourselves to output 
    + age corrected carcass weight (CW)
    + carcass confirmation (CC)
    + carcass fat (CF)
* Above traits will be included in aggregate genotype ($H$)

$$H = a^T \cdot u$$


## Economic Evaluation

```{r gel-implbp-prodsys, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", out.width="11cm"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/gel-implbp-prodsys.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/gel-implbp-prodsys.png")
```


## Economic Values

* ... also known as economic weights
* Change of profit ($P$) due to small change of trait mean ($\mu_x$)
* For trait $x$ with mean $\mu_x$, the economic value $a_x$ is defined as

$$a_x = \frac{\partial P}{\partial \mu_x}$$


## Genetic Evaluation

* Statistical modelling
* Stochastic relationship between genetic background and phenotypic expression
* Contrast: deterministic modelling in physics, e.g. law of gravity


## Statistical Modelling
* In most cases, two steps plus preparation
* Given: dataset on breeding animals containing traits of interest as response variables and predictor variables
* Preparation: do model selection to eliminate unimportant predictor variables
* Steps:
    1. variance components estimation
    2. prediction of breeding values
