## Why Statistical Modelling {#gel-modsel-why-stat-mod}
In nature we can observe two types of dependencies between physical quantities. 

1. deterministic dependencies
2. stochastic dependencies.

The difference between the two types of dependencies is shown in Diagram \@ref(fig:deter-vs-stoch). 


### Deterministic Dependencies {#gel-modsel-deter-dep}
An example for a **deterministic** dependency is Newton's law of gravity in physics. If a certain object, e.g. an apple is falling from a certain height $h$ to the ground, then the law of gravity tells us exactly how long it takes until the apple hits the ground. In principle this is only true, if we ignore any influences coming from air resistance or any wind effects. But if we wanted to we can include these effects also and we would obtain the exact time $t$ after which the apple lands on the ground. Except for measuring error there would be no source of uncertainty that would affect our resulting time $t$. 

Other examples of deterministic dependencies are the motion of the planets around the sun or some thermodynamic processes.

#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/deter-vs-stoch.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/deter-vs-stoch.png")
```



### Stochastic Dependencies {#gel-modsel-stoch-dep}
In contrast to the above mentioned deterministic dependencies, there is this second type of the **stochastic** dependencies. An example of a stochastic dependency is the decomposition of a phenotypic value into its genetic part and its environmental part, using a genetic model. The difference between a stochastic and a deterministic dependency is that in a system that is described using stochastic dependencies, there are many sources of uncertainty. The different sources of uncertainties have many different origins. First, for most quantitative phenotypes, we do not know all the genes that are responsible for the expression of a certain phenotypic value. Second, even if we knew all genes that cause a certain phenotype, we still do not know all the post-translational processes that are important for the observation of a certain phenotypic level. The same is true for the environmental part. On the one hand it is impossible to observe and to measure all environmental components and on the other hand, in most cases, we do not know how the environmental components affect a certain phenotypic value.

As a result, both the genetic part and the environmental part of a given phenotypic value are associated with very many different sources of uncertainty. Fortunately, we have the tool of statistical modelling available. Statistical modelling can incorporate sources of uncertainty and is able to make quantitative statements about different identifiable factors that affect a given quantity of interest. 


### Statistical Model {#gel-modsel-stat-model}
A statistical model is an object that consists of four parts

1. response variable $y$
2. predictor variables $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k$
3. residual term $e$
4. function $m(x)$ 

In practice a statistical model must be viewed in a context of a given dataset. This dataset consists of a set of records. In an ideal situation every record contains one observation of the response variable and of one observation of all the predictor variables. In the statistical model, the response variable $y$ is expressed as a function ($m(x)$) of the predictor variables plus the residual term $e$. For a given observation $y_i$, this can be expressed with the following formula

\begin{equation}
y_i = m(x_i) + e_i
(\#eq:gel-modsel-statmodel)
\end{equation}

where $x_i$ stands for the vector of the predictor variables $x_{i,1}, x_{i,2}, \ldots, x_{i,k}$ belonging to observation $i$. The class of available functions $m(x)$  that could be used in a statistical model is infinitely large. Experiences have shown that restricting the possible functions $m(x)$ to linear functions is not too restrictive for most datasets and it does yield very valuable results. Hence in what follows, we are just using linear functions for our statistical model. 

Besides the choice of the class of functions $m(x)$ that will be used, there is also the question whether all predictor variables $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k$ are really required to explain the response variable $y$. This question is answered by a technique that is called __model selection__ which will be explained in the following sections.


## Selecting The Best Model {#gel-modsel-select-best-model}
The aim of model selection is to find from a set of predictor variables those which are __relevant__ for the response variable. Relevance in this context means that variability of the predictor is associated with variability of the response variable. Furthermore this co-existence of variability of predictors and response has to be quantifiable by a linear function, such as the one given in the model \@ref(eq:gel-modsel-linmodel). 

In a practical data analysis setting, the dataset used as input to the analysis may have many predictor variables. But it is not guaranteed that all of them have an influence on the response variable. Because we want to model the responses with a linear function of the predictor variables, every additional predictor variable introduces an additional coefficient that must be estimated. Every estimated coefficient leads to more variability in the predicted response values of a given model. Hence if a model should be used to predict new responses based on observed predictor values, the increased variability decreases the predictive power. 

We assume the following linear model

\begin{equation}
y_i = \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j x_{ij} + \epsilon_i \quad (i = 1, \ldots, n)
(\#eq:gel-modsel-linmodel)
\end{equation}

where $\epsilon_1, \ldots, \epsilon_n$ are identically independently distributed (i.i.d) with $E(\epsilon_i) = 0$ and $var(\epsilon_i) = \sigma^2$. The model selection problem can be stated by the following question. 

> "Which of the predictor variables should be used in the linear model?"

As already mentioned, it may be that not all of the $p$ predictor variables included in the full model shown in \@ref(eq:gel-modsel-linmodel) are relevant. Predictors that are not relevant should not be included in a model because every coefficient of a predictor must be estimated and leads to increased variability of the fitted model. In case where this variability is caused by non-relevant predictor variables, the predictive power of the estimated model is lowered. As a consequence, we are often looking for an __optimal__ or the __best__ model given the available input dataset.


## Bias-Variance Trade-Off {#gel-modsel-biasvar}
What was explained above can be formalized a bit more. Suppose, we are looking for optimizing the prediction

\begin{equation}
\sum_{r=1}^q \hat{\beta}_{j_r}x_{ij_r}
(\#eq:gel-modsel-optpred)
\end{equation}

which includes $q$ relevant predictor variables with indices taken from the vector $j$ with $j_1, \ldots, j_q \in \{1, \ldots, p \}$. The average mean squared error of the prediction in \@ref(eq:gel-modsel-optpred) can be computed as 

\begin{align}
MSE  &=  n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n E\left[(m(x_i) - \sum_{r=1}^q \hat{\beta}_{j_r}x_{ij_r})^2 \right] \notag \\
     &=  n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \left(E\left[\sum_{r=1}^q \hat{\beta}_{j_r}x_{ij_r} \right] - m(x_i) \right)^2
         + n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n var(\sum_{r=1}^q \hat{\beta}_{j_r}x_{ij_r})
(\#eq:gel-modsel-mse)
\end{align}

where $m(.)$ denotes the linear function in the true model with $p$ predictor variables. The systematic error $n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \left(E\left[\sum_{r=1}^q \hat{\beta}_{j_r}x_{ij_r} \right] - m(x_i) \right)^2$ is called squared bias and this quantity is expected to decrease as the number of predictors $q$ increases. But the variance term increases with the number of predictors $q$. This fact is called the __bias-variance trade-off__ which is present in many applications in statistics. Now finding the best model corresponds to finding the model that optimizes the bias-variance trade-off. This process is also referred to as __regularization__. 


## Mallows $C_p$ Statistic {#gel-modsel-mallowcp}
The mean square error in \@ref(eq:gel-modsel-mse) is unknown because we do not know the magnitude of the bias. But MSE can be estimated. 

Let us denote by $SSE(\mathcal{M})$ the residual sum of squares in the model $\mathcal{M}$. Unfortunately $SSE(\mathcal{M})$ cannot be used to estimate $MSE$ because $SSE(\mathcal{M})$ becomes smaller the more predictors are included in the model $\mathcal{M}$. The number of predictors in the model $\mathcal{M}$ is also often referred to as the size of the model and is written as $|\mathcal{M}|$. 

For any (sub-) model $\mathcal{M}$ which involves some (or all) of the predictor variables, the mean square error ($MSE$) can be estimated by

\begin{equation}
\widehat{MSE} = n^{-1} SSE(\mathcal{M}) - \hat{\sigma}^2 + 2\hat{\sigma}^2 |\mathcal{M}| / n
(\#eq:gel-modsel-estmse)
\end{equation}

where $\hat{\sigma}^2$ is the error variance estimate in the full model and $SSE(\mathcal{M})$ is the residual sum of squares in the sub-model $\mathcal{M}$. Hence to find the best model, we could search for the sub-model $\mathcal{M}$ that minimizes $\widehat{MSE}$. Because $\hat{\sigma}^2$ and $n$ are constants with respect to sub-models $\mathcal{M}$, we can also consider the well-known $C_p$ statistic

\begin{equation}
C_p(\mathcal{M}) = \frac{SSE(\mathcal{M})}{\hat{\sigma}^2} - n + 2 |\mathcal{M}|
(\#eq:gel-modsel-mallowcp)
\end{equation}

and search for the sub-model $\mathcal{M}$ minimizing the $C_p$ statistic. 


## Searching For The Best Model With Respect To $C_p$ {#gel-modsel-searchbestmodelcp}
If the full model has $p$ predictor variables, there are $2^p-1$ sub-models (every predictor can be considered in a sub-model or not. The empty sub-model without any predictors is excluded here). 

```{r maxnrpred, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
max_nr_pred <- 16
```

Therefore, an exhaustive search for the sub-model $\mathcal{M}$ minimizing $C_p$ is only feasible if $p$ is less than $`r max_nr_pred`$ which results in $2^{`r max_nr_pred`} - 1 = `r 2^max_nr_pred - 1`$ sub-models to be tested. If $p$ is much larger, we can proceed with one of the two following stepwise algorithms. 


### Forward Selection {#gel-modsel-forward}
1. Start with the smallest model $\mathcal{M}_0$ with only a general mean as the current model
2. Include the predictor variable to the current model which reduces the residual sum of squares the most.
3. Continue with step 2 until all predictor variables have been chosen or until a large number of predictor variables have been selected. This produces a sequence of sub-models $\mathcal{M}_0 \subseteq \mathcal{M}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{M}_2 \subseteq \ldots$
4. Choose the model in the sequence $\mathcal{M}_0 \subseteq \mathcal{M}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{M}_2 \subseteq \ldots$ with the smallest $C_p$ value.


### Backward Selection {#gel-modsel-backward}
1. Start with the full model $\mathcal{M}_0$ as the current model. The full model is the model including all $p$ predictor variables
2. Exclude the predictor variable from the current model which increases the residual sum of squares the least.
3. Continue with step 2 until all predictor values have been deleted (or a large number of variables have been deleted). This produces a sequence of sub-models $\mathcal{M}_0 \supseteq \mathcal{M}_1 \supseteq \mathcal{M}_2 \supseteq \ldots$.
4. Choose the model in the sequence $\mathcal{M}_0 \supseteq \mathcal{M}_1 \supseteq \mathcal{M}_2 \supseteq \ldots$ which has the smallest $C_p$ value.


### Considerations {#gel-modsel-considerations}
Backward selection (\@ref(gel-modsel-backward)) typically leads to better results than forward selection, but it is computationally more expensive. But in the case where $p \geq n$, the full model cannot be fitted and backward selection is not possible. Forward selection might then be a possibility, but alternative estimation procedures such as LASSO might be a better solution. 


## Alternative Model Selection Criteria {#gel-modsel-alternative}
Other popular criteria to estimate the predictive potential of an estimated model are Akaike'w information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Both of them are based on the likelihood and require therefore assumptions about the distribution of the data. 

The goodness of the fit of the linear model for explaining the data is quantified by the coefficient of determination which is typically abbreviated by $R^2$ where 

\begin{equation}
R^2 = \frac{||\hat{y} - \bar{y}||^2}{||y - \bar{y}||^2}
(\#eq:gel-modsel-coeffdeter)
\end{equation}

where $||\hat{y} - \bar{y}||^2$ are the sum of squares explained by the model and $||y - \bar{y}||^2$ stands for the total sum of squares around the global mean $\bar{y}$. The coefficient of determination $R^2$ is always increasing the more predictor variables are included in the model. This behavior can be corrected as proposed in `r met$add("Yin2001")`. This correction includes the number of predictor variables an hence reduces the favoring of the full model. The result of the correction is the adjusted $R^2$ which is computed as

\begin{equation}
R_{adj}^2 = 1 - (1 - R^2) \frac{n-1}{n-p-1}
(\#eq:gel-modsel-adjr2)
\end{equation}

where $R^2$ is the unadjusted coefficient of determination given by \@ref(eq:gel-modsel-coeffdeter), $n$ stands for the number of observations and $p$ is the number of predictor variables. The formula in \@ref(eq:gel-modsel-adjr2) holds for sub-models that include an intercept term. For sub-models without intercept, the $-1$ in both numerator and the denominator of \@ref(eq:gel-modsel-adjr2) can be dropped.

The adjusted coefficient of determination ($R_{adj}^2$) allows to assess the goodness of fit of a model. That assessment considers the number of predictor variables included in the model.
