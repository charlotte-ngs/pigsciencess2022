@Article{Phocas1998,
  abstract = {This paper presents a procedure for the development of a breeding objective for a beef cattle breed used in a range of production systems. The five main beef cattle production systems in France were first described and then equations of income and costs as a function of the 25 biological traits to be genetically improved for breeding and production were established. Economic values for individual systems were defined as the first derivative of the herd profit with respect to these 25 traits while the economic values for the overall breeding objective were taken as the average of economic values over the five production systems. An application is presented for the Limousin breed. Sensitivity of the breeding objective to variation in the economic or demographic context was also studied. Breeding traits, especially maternal effects on weaning weight and calving success, were identified as the most economically important traits requiring improvement. Relative economic values were very robust with respect to variations in system frequencies and replacement rates. A dramatic change in the market price for beef (-50{\%}) increased the relative weighting of carcass quality traits to the detriment of breeding traits although a smaller change in beef price (-25{\%}) had no significant effect on the relative economic values. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

@Article{Yin2001,
  abstract = {Abstract The effectiveness of various analytical formulas for estimating R 2 shrinkage in multiple regression analysis was investigated. Two categories of formulas were identified: estimators of the squared population multiple correlation coefficient ($\rho$2) and those of the squared population cross-validity coefficient ($\rho$c 2). The authors conducted a Monte Carlo experiment to investigate the effectiveness of the analytical formulas for estimating R 2 shrinkage, with 4 fully crossed factors (squared population multiple correlation coefficient, number of predictors, sample size, and degree of multicollinearity) and 500 replications in each cell. The results indicated that the most widely used Wherry formula (in both SAS and SPSS) is probably not the most effective analytical formula for estimating $\rho$2. Instead, the Pratt formula and the Browne formula outperformed other analytical formulas in estimating $\rho$2 and $\rho$c 2, respectively.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY A method is proposed for estimating intra-block and inter-blook weights in the analysis of incomplete block designs with block sizes not necessarily equal. The method consists of maximizing the likelihood, not of all the data, but of a set of selected error contrasts. When block sizes are equal results are identical with those obtained by the method of Nelder (1968) for generally balanced designs. Although mainly concerned with incomplete block designs the paper also gives in outline an extension of the modified maximum likelihood procedure to designs with a more complicated block structure.},

General elements of Bayesian inference, e.g., prior and posterior distributions, informative vs noninformative priors, likelihood functions, finite samples, “memory” properties and integration of nuisance parameters are illustrated with animal breeding examples. Shrinkage estimators are discussed from a Bayesian viewpoint. A general framework for estimation of breeding value with or without selection or assortative mating, including the situation where variances and covariances are unknown, is presented. Selection indexes, best linear unbiased prediction, nonlinear merit functions, nonlinear models and estimation of genetic parameters are discussed from a Bayesian perspective.},
